<h1>Welcome to fancy!</h1>
<p>Fancy is an event-driven(epoll) based high-performance Web server. The principle is similar to Nginx and can be viewed as a simplified version of Nginx.
    Fancy is being developed and currently only supports GET method and static page access.</p>

<p><em>Thank you for using fancy.</em></p>
